# Grabbing Mechanic
The latest Build was created in Unreal Engine 5.0.2

In many first-person shooter games, there is a mechanic to grab an enemy. But most of the time other enemies don't react to this event. They will shoot at you anyway. In reality a person would not shoot at you because they would be afraid of accidently hurting thier ally. 

This is why I tried to make another approach where an enemy would raise their arms up when you grab an ally. After a short time the enemy would try to move around the player to find a way to land a shot on the player without hitting his ally.

This Project was created during my Gameplay Programming lecture at the University. It was my first try to create a prototype in Unreal with C++. It is not perfect and kinda wanky but I like it anyways.

The purpose of the lecture was to show the students how a development loop works. To achieve this we created several documents and a prototype.
First, I needed to pitch my idea to the other students and listen to what they thought. With the new input, I created a Game Design Document and started to implement the prototype.

After the first attempt was finished I gave the prototype to other students for playtesting. Therefore a Playtest Document was needed to describe my intentions, how the prototype works and what the controls are.
After the other students evaluated my prototype I created an evaluation document with all the new inputs, how the test was structured and how to continue. After this, I implemented the new features and created a technical documentation. The documents, code and a windows Build can be found in the repository.
